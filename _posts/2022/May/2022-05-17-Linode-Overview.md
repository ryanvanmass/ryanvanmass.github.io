## What is Linode?
Linode is a VPS provider primarily focused in the US and Canada

### What is a VPS?
A Virtual Private Server or VPS is essentially a virtual machine hosted on someone else’s hardware in the cloud

## Pricing and offering
Linode has some of the lowest and most straight forward Pricing of any of the VPS I have look into

## What Makes Linode Unique
### Key Features
#### Linode CLI
Linode’s Python3 based API CLI is second to none. During the Days and weeks I have been using Linode I have found that I prefer it over the Web UI

#### Clean and Simple UI (Dashboard)
The Simple to use UI reveals all the features required to use the platform in a clean and easy to use way.

#### Wide Variety of Distributions
At the time of writing Linode has one the widest offerings of Distributions that I have seen in a cloud provider. It Includes:

* Alma
* Alpine
* Arch
* CentOS Stream
* Debian
* Fedora
* Gentoo
* Rockey
* Slackware
* Ubuntu
* OpenSuse

#### Performance
Between the all SSD storage and high speed Networking to the Hypervisors you will have no issues running your applications on their back bone. Additionally in the admittedly short period of time I have been using them and the slightly longer I have been looking into them I have seen no major outages causing downtime of active services (VMs)

## The Good and the Bad
### The Good
* Low Cost
* High Performance
* Amazing CLI to interact with the API
* Supports many Linux Content Creators

### The Bad
* Linode leaves SSH password authentication enabled by default
* Only Linux Virtual Machines
* I was shadow banned for no apparent reason and had to email there support multiple times to try and find out why and never received a response just my account was activated one day
* Charged in USD

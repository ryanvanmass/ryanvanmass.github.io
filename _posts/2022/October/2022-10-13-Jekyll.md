Jekyll is a static site generator that allows you to have eligent, easy to maintain, and modern websites without the headaches of supporting and maintaining a Wordepress server

## Why do I care?
This site actually started out as a Static Site generated via Hugo on Netify then Digital Oceans App platform before I migrated to Wordpress. During my time on wordpress I missed a few key advantages of a static site. Bellow are the big ones:
* The Simplicity of writing posts in a Markdown File
* The lack of security maintance
* The ability to easily write posts on my IPad (Which I am currently)

## So why Jekyll?
The reason I choose Jekyll over going back to Hugo is simply do to falling in love with the theme that is now present on the website it gives my website the modern facelift it needed and gave me features I had been wanting for quite awhilte such as a table of content for each post and a site wide search functionality

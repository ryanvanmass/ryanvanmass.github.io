A lot happened this year some of the highlights are I got married and went on a once in a life time honeymoon, I got to fulfill a life long dream of visiting Massenhoven, I started a new job where i am performing a more technical role, I could probobly keep going but I think I have made my point. One thing stands out to me in both the highlights I meantioned here as well as the ones I didn't mention is that my amazing wife was always by my side supporting me especially when it came time to make the leap and take a new job opertunity on, I would be lieing if I said I was anything other then terrified but with her support I was able to make that leap and honestly it was probobly one of the best decisions I made all year.

While I had a amazing year there were still some dark patches I know far to many people who will not be brining in 2023 with us because they are no longer walking among us, some lived long happy lives and some left there family's far to soon. To the family's both in my life as well as those I have never met that are pushing through the holidays for the first time without a loved one it may seem impossible now but remember the joy that they brought you while they were here and take comfort in that it does become easier to continue on.

From a technical standpoint I acheived alot this year I implemented proper network seporation within my LAN so that I can limit the scope of unauthorized access attempts to my deployed services, I implemented a Active Directory domain to allow me to have single sign on for most of my services (hopefully in 2023 this will become all), I finally impmented a proper data backup strategry for all my services running in my homelab, I designed and implemented a far more manageable and maintainable website, and likely so much more. Even as i am finishing up this post on New Years eve I have an ever growing list of Homelab related tasks that i want to complete before the end of the year.

From what few plans for 2023 I know of at this point it is shaping up to be a pretty great year. I hope everyone has a great holiday season and an even better 2023

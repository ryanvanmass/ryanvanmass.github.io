## Disclamer
This post is by no means a definitive guide or medical advise. This is simply what I have found works for me.

## What is ADHD
ADHD or Attention Defaced disorder is a medical condition that causes you to find it difficult if not impossible to focus on one task at a time or to stay focused for long periods of time.

## So How do you Focus?
### Planning your Day
If I don't plan out my day the chances of me actually getting anything done drop exponentially. In my experience unless I plan my day first thing in the morning (right after making coffee) I wont plan it out which of course leads to me not getting anything done that day.

#### Sticking to your Plan
I have also found it useful to have my todo list always visible as a reminder of what you are suposed to be dong. This way you can always glance at it and remember what you should be working on and what is next on your list

### Taking Breaks
As funny as it may sound one of the most useful tools I have found that helps me focus is taking breaks. Taking a break allows you to relax and not focus on anything so that when it comes time again to focus you are ready and able.

#### Taking breaks to "focus" on something you enjoy
I have found it useful to add a couple tasks that I am looking forward to or enjoy doing in to my plan for the day so that way I can use them to push myself to complete the other tasks on my todo list.

### Removing distractions
One of the best things I did in College was buying a good pair of noice cancelling headphones. This allows me to block out all the distractions of the outside world while still being able to listen to the music, podcasts, or Youtube videos that help me focus

#### Background Noice
As I just eluded to I spent a good portion of my day with something playing. This allows me to focus because in addition to helping block out the outside world it also helps keep me focused in on one thing instead of chasing every new thought that pops into my mind.

### Learning when you are most focused
while my level of focus varys from day to day I do find I am most focused first thing in the morning and then again in early evening. Knowing this allows me to plan my day around that. For example I will always do my most pressing/urgent work related tasks first thing in the morning and in the early evening I often work on a passion project such as writing posts for this website or editing pictures I have taken.

## The Most Important thing to Remember
The most important thing to remember about trying to focus when you have ADHD is to not get discouraged or mad at yourself for not being able to focus. Instead just know that tomorrow is a new day and that you can always get caught up on whatever it is you need to do.

## The Importances of statying connected
Like most people I find myself wanting to be connected to what is going on all the time. Although unlike most people I prefer to host as much of my own infustructure as possible instead of relying on services such as OneDrive or Google Drive.

### How do I Stay Securely Connected?
I primarily stay connected to my self hosted infustructure via a VPN that I have set up on a VPS (Virtual Private Server). This allows me to always be able to connect to my local network virtually, Where this can be useful is when the world does reopen and I begin travelling more again. I will be able to access my file server from anywhere that I have a internet connection which thanks to my phone having aton of data and how easy it is to hotspot between Apple devices is just about anywhere.

## Why always being connected can be useful.
If you are anything like me you hate being stuck behind your desk but you still need to be able to get work done. Being always connected allows you to be able to just get up, grab your computer and go work somewhere else that has an internet connection, Which thanks to mobile data is almost anywhere.

__Syncthing__

Synthing is a file syncing app so that you always have an identical copy of a file in multiple locations such as your server and main laptop or your desktop and laptop

__Serveditor__

Serveditor is an IPad optimized client for Code-Server, which is an web app based IDE.

__Firefox or Chrome__

If you are like me you use Windows instead of OSX being able to send tabs between devices is awesome for looking up something quicking while your out and continue reading about it on your computer when you get home, or having all your bookmarks on all your devices is amazing.

## Being too connected
While being conected can be great it is very important to know when to disconnect so that you aren't working 24/7. Personally while it is rare that I leave the house for any extended period of time without my IPad which is connected to all my work as well as personal accounts, it is rare that I use it for anything more then watching a youtube video when I am taking a break from driving or sitting in a parking lot eating because when I am not home and not working that is my time to disconnect generally. Now there are exceptions to that sometimes I decied to work while out and about but those are far and few between.

I recently went on a short get away to be able to relax and unwind after everything that has happened over the last year. I decided to do something on this trip that I have never done and thought I would never do and that was leave my Laptop at home, I traveled with nothing but my IPad and IPhone. This post will be going over some of the really cool ways that this setup allowed me to either just as easily or more easily complete all the same tasks that I normally would.

## Productivity
Having my VPN gateway set up allowed me to easily connect to my self-hosted services, such as my file server and website draft server. Having access to these allowed me to easily work on the notes for this post as well as the post itself.

The IPad defaulting to the desktop version of websites allowed me to easily look up attractions in the area we were well in the car without having to deal with the truly terrible mobile versions most websites have.

## Photography
It's likely a surprise to no one with me using both an IPhone and IPad that I use ICloud to sync my pictures between them. I never really appreciated how seamless this was until i was getting back in the car from taking a picture of something and grabbed my IPad because i wanted to do a quick edit to see what it would look like to have the picture i wanted to edit already sitting on my IPad waiting for me. That's not to be underscored by how easy it is and how useful it can be to be able to edit your pictures while you are still sitting at the location you took them at to make sure that you don't want to get a slightly different image to work with


## Entertainment
While I was in the Hotel room I did have an Android Box with me to be able to watch what ever I or more accurately my Fiance wanted, shout out to EDMI for having amazing customer service as well as a great product you can find out more about them on there website [here](https://www.shopedmi.com/). While the android box was great for the hotel room it wasn't very useful for while I was in the car, for that I actually didn't watch to much since one of the main goals for the trip was to go site seeing but I did listen to part of an audio book and watch a movie on my phone which both were alright but all in all trying to watch tv or movies on your phone at least still sucks and your IPad is almost to big to watch anything for an extended period of time for in a vehicle.

## Misc
I liked the ability that the IPad had to automatically connect to an IPhones Hotspot before the trip but I didn't didn't really appreciate it until I was on the trip. 

## Conclusion
Traveling with an IPad can work very well depending on what you want to do while you are travelling. I would recommend giving it a try

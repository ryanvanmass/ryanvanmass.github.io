# Photography
* It has been great just being able to grab my phone and take pics and no they will be on my Ipad to edit them
* Being able to edit the Pictures while in the Car is as amazing
*

# Productivity
* being able to connect to my Self hosted infrastructure via a VPN connection and work on writing notes for this post is great
* The Desktop Version Default for web browsing allowed me to easily edit the SSH Keys for Github since apparently i forgot to do it after a server upgrade for my file/hugo server
* Being ablility to just be able to sit down at the hotel room desk and start working was great. I didn't have to worry about if my laptop was dead or where i could plug it in

# Entertainment
* It is nice having the Airpods 2 and how much better the seemless switching between IOS devices is then the original it allowed me to be listening to an audiobook and seemlessly switch to a facebook video on my other phone then switch back

# Portability
* The Ipad Air is a nice size to fit in my lap so i can type or edit photos well in the car

# Misc
* The ability to be able to automatically connect the Ipad to a hotspot from an Iphone on the same Icloud account is great for travelling (Would be less useful with a cellular Ipad)

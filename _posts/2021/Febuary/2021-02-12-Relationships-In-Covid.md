## Background on my story
I have been with my Fiance for the last 6 years the majority of this time was spent dating long distance, I decided that for christmas of 2020 that i was going to surprise my at the time Girlfriend and proposed of course she said yes.

## Dating
### A little more background
So when Covid first hit i was living by myself finishing my schooling. I very quickly realized that my little one bedroom appartment was not going to be big enough for me to keep my sanity, so i wound up going to live my at the time still girlfriend and her family.

### So Dating?
while i know i had a unique learning cerve of going from dating long distance to living with the person your dating in the course of an hour (yes the decision was made that fast). I still experanced alot of the same issues alot of couples experanced while dating in a global pandemic. Some of the issues i personally ran into are:
* Living ontop of each other all day everyday
* learning how to live with your Sigificant other when you cant leave the house
* The ability to go on what you knew as a date is now essentually illigal
* dealing with depression while trying to maintain a relashionship

I know alot of couples that did not survive quarintining together, hell i came closer then i would like to admit most days, and to be honest i can see why alot of couples did wind up breaking up because there is a huge different between living together and both you and your Significant other have to leave to go to work and everyone working from home and spending all day everyday with each other.

## Being Engaged
### Some Background
As i meantioned earlier I only got engaged back at Christmas.

### So being Engaged?
Honestly atleast so far being engaged isnt much easier then dating was. You still run into all the same issues and have all the same problems.

## Being Married
I can only speculate on this one since im not married yet, but i suspect it will be very similar to Dating and being Engaged because guess what you will still have all the same issues and problems potentially

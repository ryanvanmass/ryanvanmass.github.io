## Background
I recently decided to make a change to my workflow both personally and professionally. I have decided to give using a IPad as a mobile workstation a try. To be clear for the majority of my work I am still using a Windows or Linux based PC's but I wanted to see if I can replace my old, large, and bulky laptop that I have been using when I don't feel like working at my desk with a Tablet I also wanted the ability to more easily work while on the go as while Covid has prevented me from traveling as much as I would like I do still travel to visit family and friends a fair bit (when Provincial and National restriction allow). Bellow will be a a short synopsis of my day to day requirements for and usage of technology.

### Work
I work as a Technical Support Analyst supporting over 60 sites across North America. I spend the vast majority of my time in remote desktop software as well as a web browser both for helpdesk as well as making configuration changes. I also spend alot of time in my email both sending and receiving emails

### Personal
I spend the majority of my time listening to Youtube while either administrating my own servers or working on this website.

## The Setup
As important as my impressions and observation are they are all but useless if i don't include what i am using as a setup, bellow is a full list of the hardware I have utilized during my testing

### IPad Air

### Apple Pencel 2

## The First Week
* For the first few days i utilized the app version of all the main services i use with the exception of the helpdesk software we use at work as i already knew i would prefer the web version as it gives me more control over how i interact with the helpdesk. Around Day 4 i started using youtube in the web browser instead of in the app as it will allow me to use picture in picture mode allowing me to do such things as listen to a youtube video while writing this post.
* I like the versatility of being able to use the IPad as a tablet when i need a tablet and as a small laptop when i need a laptop. A large part of this i believe is due to by default in the web browser IPad OS displays the desktop version of websites instead of the mobile version favored by IOS (IPhones).
* It is nice how my AirPods can be seamlessly switched between my IPhone and my IPad allowing me to only carry one pair of headphones for all my devices
* Not being able to easily silence all notifications is proving annoying.
  * I have since discovered there is an easy to access software button in the control center
* The Type C Charging is a little annoying as it means when traveling in addition to carrying a lightning cable for my iPhone and AirPods i also need to carry a type C cable for my IPad, but if it means that apple accepts the industry standard for mobile devices long term i am happy to carry the 2 cables for the time being
* The Lack of a headphone jack or type c to headphone adapter was a tad annoying when i wanted to connect my IPad to some audio equipment to listen to music. Easily solvable with a cheap adapter from Amazon that i can just throw in my bag for the once in a blue moon i want to actually connect it to a sound system

## The Second Week
* This week I integrated the IPad into my workflow for meetings at work utilizing it to more easily take notes in said meetings. I have been both utilizing the Apple Pencel as well as the keyboard to take notes depending on the meeting, For those curious I use OneNote for all my note taking.
* I have begun testing the set up as a more portal way to be able to not always be stuck at my desk all day. I am utilizing remote desktop software to connect to my PC at my desk for the few jobs that i cannot complete on my IPad which are proving to far and few in between

## The Third Week
* So Far this week I find myself reaching for my IPad for more and more of my day to day tasks such as:
    * Creating My ToDo List each day
    * Checking my Email
    * Catching what happened overnight on the Helpdesk for work
    * Checking my Calendar
* By the end of the week it is rare that I am not found in the same room as my IPad
* This week I had to troubleshoot an issue with one of my servers all but dieing. Once I got past the Server not connecting to the network the IPad was a very useful tool to have a ssh session open to easily copy config's from backups and Documentation I have

## Conclusion
While IPadOS still has a long way to go before I would look at replacing my Windows and Linux PC's with it as my daily driver. I do believe it is ready to replace my old Laptop thats sole purpose was to allow me to not be at my desk when doing some work. It allows me to do 80% of what I would normally do on my PC's and for the most part thanks to cross platform tools as well as a few self hosted ones I am able to use the same tools on both my IPad as well as my PC's. I have included a Wish list of features I hope Apple adds to IPadOS

### Wish List
* Proper multi-monitor support.
  * Currently you can only mirror your IPad display it would be nice to be able to use it as a second display like on a traditional PC
* The ability to change trackpad and mouse settings individually
  * I want the ability to configure natural scrolling depending on if i am using a trackpad or a mouse
* The ability to use multitasking with more then 2 apps at a time

## What is RealVNC
RealVNC is a remote desktop software that allows you to remotely connect to a PC with the Server software and an internet connection from anywhere as long as you also have a internet connection and the viewer software.

## Why Use RealVNC
RealVNC while being forced to use both their viewer and server software, it allows them to handle all the "hard" stuff such as port forwarding allowing you to utilize it for providing remote support with little to no effert from the person you are trying to support.

### Disadvantages of RealVNC:
* With the free licence you can only have 5 sevices running the server software
* You have to use both there server and viewer software

### Advantages of RealVNC:
* Easlily provide remote support
* Easy to set up
* Nice Interface (atleast in my opinion)

## RealVNC for the Family IT Guy
In my personal experiance one of the hardest part of being the family IT guy is when a family member calls you becuase that thing you set up isnt working is not being able to see what they are talking about and having to have them describe it. There are many softwares out there that resolve this issue like TeamViewer or AnyDesk. While most of these softwares have free offerings either they limit the software tools that make the software useful or in TeamViewers case they have some proccess that determines (usally incorrectly in my experiance) if you are using it for buisness use and bricks the install and the account until you buy a licence.

RealVNC takes a different approach. To my knowlege you get the full software tool set or atleast they give you access to all the tools that make the software useful for an application like this. The only limitation that they seem to set is that with the free licence you can only have 5 Devices running the server software associated with a account at any given time.

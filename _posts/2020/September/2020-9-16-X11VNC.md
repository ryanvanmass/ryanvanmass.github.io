## A little Background
If you are anything like me you have had many issues getting a VNC server to run on any desktop enviorment other gnome (which has it built in). This post will be going over what I have recently found to be probobly the easiest and most full proof way to get VNC running on any desktop enviorment.

## Installation and Configuration Steps
1. Install Dependancies

```bash
sudo apt install x11vnc
```

2. Configure X11VNC Password

```bash
x11nvc -storepassw+d
```

3. Configuring it to run at boot

```bash
crontab -e
```
copy the bellow text correcting for your user profile

```
@reboot x11vnc -auth guess -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /home/ryan/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -shared
```
4. Reboot

```bash
reboot
```

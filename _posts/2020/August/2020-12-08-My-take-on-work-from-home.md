## Introduction
So a little insight for a little over a year now I have been working from home full time and now with Covid-19 I also go to college from home. So it is safe to say that I spend a lot of time in front of my desk at home.

## Getting out of the office
Getting out of the office is a weird and tough concept when you work from home. You never really leave the office and if you're like me (working in IT) even when you do leave your house, work still follows you in the form of emails and phone calls. Finding a work-life balance is crucial if you want to be able to do it long term. One thing I found that has helped me is having a separate computer that has all my work stuff on it so that way I have to take out that computer to be able to do work if I want to do it when I'm not actually working.

## Taking your office mobile and going offline
So today I decided to try something new, I decided to take my office mobile as I am writing this I am currently sitting under a train bridge by a river and it has been amazing to be able to sit somewhere and do something put my laptop back in my bag go somewhere else and continue working on something else and with not having the internet distracting me it has allowed me to focus on whatever it is I'm working on without the distractions of Facebook, Youtube, Messenger, etc.

## Taking your Office to the local coffee shop
This has always been a weird concept to me why would you want to go to a coffee shop to do work. But once again as I am writing this I am now sitting at a picnic table in a park and its starting to make more sense. I am getting a lot more work done not having the distractions of my Xbox and TV fighting for my attention. I can now see the benefit of having an internet connection in that environment so that you can answer email or update Github repositories or answer questions on a community forum.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I would recommend that if you have the opportunity to get out of the house to work every now and again take that opportunity and enjoy it.

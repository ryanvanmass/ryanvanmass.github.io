## The Good
I am aware that 2020 has been a very difficult and devastating year for many people, but i can't help but reflect on how a single decision i made back in March when the world started to shutdown changed my year dramatically. That decision was to say "Fuck 2020 I'm still going to do everything i have planned for this year". Ok a little background back in January i was like most people in the fact that 2020 was going to be "my year" it was the start of a new decade as well as the start of a new year, and well plans have changed and have been adapted due to Covid 19 at the time of writing this post I only have 2 goals left to achieve this year and both are on track to be completed by the time i post this. 

### Update
I have now completed both of those remaining goals

## The Bad
Now don't get me wrong 2020 wasn't perfect by a long shot I do have regrets from this year such as not spending more time with my friends and not always being there for those who needed me even when they were there when i needed them. But while it is important to reflect on both the good and the bad it is even more important that the past is the past and all you can do is learn from it and try to do better in the future.

If you are reading this i hope you have a Happy, Heathy, and Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

## Introduction
Rclone is a open source project that allows you to interact with a variety of cloud storage solutions. Rclone supports platforms such as Onedrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox. You can find a full list of supported platforms at [rclone.org](https://rclone.org#providers).

## Installation
### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install rclone
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install rclone
```

## Configuration
For detailed configuration information visit [rclone.org](https://rclone.org#providers) and select the config button for your desired cloud platform

## Rclone Main Features
There are two main methods of interacting with your chosen cloud platform they are as follows:
### Rclone Sync
Very similar to rsync in that it allows you to sync a local directory to a remote directory. A common use case for this method is to automate cloud back ups of a NAS.

#### Command Syntax
```bash
rclone sync -v /home/source remote_profile:destination/directory
```

### Rclone Mount
Allows you to mount your remote cloud platform as a local file share. A common use case for this method is to be able to more easily use platforms that are not natively supported on linux.

#### Command Syntax
```bash
rclone mount remote_profile: /local/mountpoint
```

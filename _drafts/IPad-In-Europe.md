I recently got married and at the time of writing am about a week into my honeymoon and while I have brought both my IPad and my Laptop I find myself more often than I expected reaching for my IPad. In this post I will be going over some of the reason why I believe that is the case.

## Easy to use on a Hotel Bed
With the Magic Keyboard the IPad becomes an increadibly easy device to use while sitting in bed after a long day of exploring. While often times the IPads small and light form factor can cause issues when I want to be productive, this can actually cause me to just do the tasks I need to get done for the next day then get back to spending time with my wife instead of falling down one of hundreds have rabbit holes I would normally go down.

## Excellent Battery Life
Even with Tailscale running so that I can watch Super Natural while in the train station the battery has lasted most if not all day without needing to be charged.

## Easy to use on trains and plains
Due to how the Magic Keyboard folds it makes the IPad far more useable on economy Train and Plain folding trays. I would go as far as to say that it actually makes it usable while on these means of transportation. I was able to easily work on this post while watching Super Natuaral and feel like I was being just as productive using my IPad as I would have been if I was using my Laptop at a traditional desk

## Airplay
With how easy it is to connect airpods to my IPad my wife and I can easily pass hours in the train stations watching some of our favourite shows such as Supernatural while waiting for our train

## Conclusion
In closing while I did still use my laptop a fair bit my IPad was an invaluable tool to allow me to get some work done as well as allow my wife and I to watch TV when there wasn't an actually TV available, which when essentally backpacking across Europe happens a fair bit.

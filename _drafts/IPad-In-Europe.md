I recently got married and at the time of writing am about a week into my honeymoon and while I have brought both my IPad and my Laptop I find myself more often then not reaching for my IPad. In this post I will be going over some of the reason why I believe that is the case.

## Excellent Battery Life
Even with Tailscale running so that I can watch Super Natural while in the train station the battery has lasted most if not all day without needing to be charged.

Anyone who knows me personally knows that I take a slightly different outlook on ADHD then a lot of people I see it as a tool. ADHD allows me to hyper focus on task or projects that I find intresting and consume knowledge at a rate rate that would make most neurotypical head spin because when I find as subject or problem intresting I will not stop thinking about it in one form or another until it is finished or resolved on the flip side though if I do not find a task or problem intresting while I will still do it it will be like pulling teeth for me to do it, I will procrastinate actually doing it as long as possible. although again on the flip side due to the more creative nature of those who are neurodivergent it allows me to determine the best course of action in any situation may be so far "out side of the box" that you cant even see the box anymore. To be clear Living with ADHD is not easy there are days you are on cloud 9 one minute and cureled up in a ball on the floor just trying to survive the anxiety the next minute.

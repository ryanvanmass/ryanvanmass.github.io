Will Hybrid work work for companies in the lont term? Personally I believe that if a company implements it correctly it can work very well. In this post I will be going over why

## The Advantages
One of the main reason I believe that it will work well for companies is it allows employees to have the best of both being in the office with all the advantages that intakes as well as the flexibility to work remotely when needed. Additionally it forces companies to reevaluate there storage and networking strategies to allow both a more collaborative and more geodiverse functionality leveraging the cloud often times utilizing tools such as Google Drive and M365

## The Disadvantages
While many companies are imbracing the transition to the cloud it has left a gap for IT professionals in how we manage security for both data storage as well as remotely accessing company resources.

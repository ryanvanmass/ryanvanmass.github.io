## Intro
So you've been thinking about making the jump and switch to MacOS. Well thats exactly what I have done, over the last month I have been running the M1 Macbook Air from 2020 as my sole daily use device with 2 notable exceptions I still kept my gaming PC for gaming and my work PC for work but everything else has been done on this macbook including writing this post.

## The First Few Days
### Initial Setup
at the Time of writing having just come back from a buisness trip where i had to wipe and setup over 20 Windows laptop Apples streamline initial setup was a breath of fresh air i think in Under 5 Min I was up and running and signed into my Apple ID. 

### First Thoughts 
* Dockey is a must to fix how slow and buggy the default auto hide behaviour of the doc
* The new keyboard shortcuts will take some getting used to although i already know some with using a keyboard on my Ipad
* The Level of integration with my other apple products is amazing. Airpod handoff is a definite highlight for me this is something I already loved with my Ipad and Iphone so to have it on my Macbook now is amazing

## The 30 Day Challenge
So at this point I had begun using getting into using it day to day and while not stricktly MacOS related the light sleek design of the Macbook Air meant I was spending more time away from my Desk, which meant I was leveraging sidecar to use my Ipad as a second monitor and honestly my only compaint about it is that I only have a 11 inch Ipad (my next Ipad may be bigger for this alone). Along with the sleek design I began taking advantage of the extreme power efficency resulting in longer battery life of the M series processors allowing me to leave the house without worrying if my laptop was going to die in my bag.

Now that I am on all Apple products I have had to rework some of my own workflows and apps I use. for example previously i used reminders as a front end for nextcloud tasks to allow me to have cross platform reminders but now I can leverage all the additional features built directly into reminders when you are using Icloud as the backend. Another example is I switched from Trillium Notes to Obsidian with Icloud Sync although that has more to do with Obsidian having a far better plugin ecosystem. Another Iphone integration that demands a shoutout is the auto connecting to a Iphone hotpot this allows me to be able to pull out my laptop and do 10-15 min of work far more easily while waiting for my wife to get off work. 

for those keeping track yes this challenge fell in the same month as WWDC and honestly I was kinda disapoint with the annoucements this year the big highlight for me was the redesign of multitasking on IpadOS. but it was nice to know that I will atleast be getting the next major release of MacOS on my 5 Year old new to me MacBook.

Honestly the begiest adjustment for me was the slight changing in the keyboard layout such as where the Windows/Super key is although that may be because I am already use to a Unix based system with being a Linux Admin at work as well as in the homelab

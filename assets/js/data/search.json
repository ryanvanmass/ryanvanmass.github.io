Well I recently made this exact same decision mainly because I was tired on how expensive cloud storage was for the few web services I manage.BackgroundFor any of this to make sense I guess I should give you a little background before the migration I had two main services I ran in Linode, a Pfsense firewall for a full tunnel “Privacy” VPN for my parents as well as a nextcloud server that my wife uses for software downloads for her customers and it was this nextcloud instance that was the catolice for the migration as well as Linode being aquired by Akimia and me having concerns how long it will remain as a service they offer but that is a conversation for another day.Planning your MigrationThere are a few main considerations that you should take into account when beginning to plan your migration1. What services are you migrating and was are you depricatingThe only service I planned on Migrating was my wifes nextcloud instance since my parents had shown intrest in no longer wanting the “Privacy” VPN2. Downtime length/Customer ImpactSince the only service I was migrating is the nextcloud instance I choose a day that the business was closed so that the impact would be minimal3. Service Level Post MigrationWhile I cant match Linodes SLA which appears to be between 99.9% and 99.99% (8.77 Hours to 52.60 Min per yerar) I do have fairly relyable internet and power and with the addition of DDNS (Dynamic DNS Client) I can likely come close4. Tech stackI choose to deploy a XCP-NG pool that was specific to External services managed by my existing Xen Orchestra Instance. I did this mainly because then it would be fully integrated with my backup and managmenet systems.5. BackupsMake sure you have a plan for both local and offsite backups. For me this is all managed via my primary TrueNAS ServerTesting before your MigrationI have found regardless of the project it is always wise to test and test and test and keep testing ontil your confident you could do the migration in your sleep and that if you do encounter any issues you have the knownelege and skill to overcome them. Personally when prepping for this migration I ran through this migration probobly a half dozen to a dozen times before the final migration. I went as far as to run a migrated version fo the serivices under a slighly different URL (eg. dev.example.com) to allow me to test and ensure that all types of clients will still be able to access the files on the migrated service once the migration is complete.Migration PlanI would reccomend running though and testing/updating your migration plan enough times that you can follow said migration plan word by word and it be idiot proof for lack of a better way of putting it.Migration DayGive yourself enough time to migarate all of the config and data I would reccomend if you have to give a estimate for how long it is going to take estimate 1.5X as long as you actually expect it to take that way you have some wiggle room for if it takes longer then you though or if you need to take a 5-10 min break to cool your nervesfor me the data transfer from starting the backup to service being back up I expected to take roughly 2 hours but i was quoting 3.5 to allow me for that extra time for if something took longer then i was expectingWith any luck if all goes well you will successfully be able to migrate back to on premise" }, { "title": "30 Day Linux Challenge 2024", "url": "/posts/Linux-Challenge-2024/", "categories": "On-Premise, Linux Desktop", "tags": "Linux, KDE", "date": "2024-07-29 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "With the recent announcement of Windows Recall I decided to give Windows the boot and give Linux another go as my daily driver. Since the last time I attempted this a few key things have changed, the largest of which is that I separated out my gaming machine from my main workstation and am utilizing game streaming to be able to play games on my desktop. So i’ve spent the last 30 days on LinuxStarting on GnomeOut of the gate we had a strong start. I choose Fedora 40 Workstation as my Distribution of choice. Once I did the tweaks that in my opinion should really be default on Gnome such as enabling the Maximize and Minimize buttons in the top bar I was left with a very usable Mac adjacent Desktop. After getting the basics set up I had 2 main objectives:GamingObviously I wanted to be able to relax and play some video games after long days at work. For quite some time now I have been using Moonlight, an open source gaming streaming client that utilizes Nvidia’s gamestream functionality built into their driver to stream games at extremely low latency over a network. You can learn more about Moonlight here. Unfortunately I very quickly ran into issues with moonlight which I had installed via flatpak crashing Gnome. I went down many rabbit holes attempting to troubleshoot this, I tried everything from networking tweaks to swapping out hardware in my workstation. Unfortunately I would end up battling this issue until the very last day of the Challenge when I finally tried the app image and discovered it appears to be an issue with how flatpak is sandboxing the program.WorkIn order to access my work machine I am utilizing RDP to access it without having to plug it into all my monitors and peripherals. Unfortunately this was a fairly bumpy road historically I have used remmina for remote desktop connections on Linux but in recent years development has slowed down and numerous bugs have been introduced one of the largest I encountered that kicked off all the other issues was under Wayland multi-monitor support in RDP simply does not work, I use 3 Monitors to efficiently perform my work so this was a non-starter, lucky using the flatpak version you can set it to use X11 for the display server using the X-Wayland compositor the only issue with that is under flatpak Remmina won’t pull all keyboard input properly so key combos and keys such as the super key (Windows Key) simply do not get passed through to the remote machine. After suffering through this for 2 2 and a half weeks I discovered the Thincast client which also is forced via flatpak to run under X11 but does properly support multi-monitor and full keyboard input. It also appeared to be slightly more performant for audio passthrough from the remote to local machines. I even got webcam pass through from my local workstation to my remote work PC working in ThincastHonestly all in all things were going well but I was running into some really weird graphical issues and unfortunately due to Gnomes signal process architecture if anything crashed one part of gnome the entire Desktop environment crashes. This lead me to around the halfway point making the swithc to Fedora KDESwitching to KDEAt the time of switching from Gnome to KDE I was still having issues with both Remmina and Moonlight. I was very sad that switching to KDE did not immediately resolve all my issues but to be fair I didn’t expect it to. Since I was switching out my desktop environment I figured I would also ensure I was using the best software which is when I discovered ThinCast Client which completely resolved my work issue sadly Moonlight Crashing my desktop environment would continue right though until the latter half of the last day. That said the transition to KDE was not in vain I have always prefered KDE over Gnome for its level of customizability the perfect example of this is my desktop is setup to look similar to windows with a bottom task bar with a similar layout to the windows 7/10 taskbar while my Laptop has a more MacOS feel with its App Dock and top bar.DevelopmentOn other big use case I have for my main workstation is development, while I do have a XCP-NG Cluster for virtualizing anything I may need it is still handy being able to spin up a ephemeral VM or Docker Container on my workstation to quickly test something and I gotta say being back on Linux was so nice with projects such as QuckEMU and good old Docker it made quick and dirt development work a breeze. Also shout out to Dolphin (KDE’s File Manager) for supporting mounting multiple different types of File Shares directly in the file bar as well as being able to open a embedded terminal window, honestly Windows could learn a thing or two on how a modern File Manager should performFinal ThoughtsAll in all the 30 day Linux Challenge was a success. I will be remaining on Linux quite happily moving forward. It has everything I require from a workstation OS and more. That said it does still have room to improve its Graphical subsystem but to be fair wayland has come leaps and bounds since I last tested it" }, { "title": "Turn any Webpage into a Electron App", "url": "/posts/Make-Any-Site-a-App/", "categories": "On-Premise", "tags": "", "date": "2024-06-29 13:30:44 +0000", "snippet": "Have you ever wanted to utilze a webpage in a more native manner through a desktop app just to discover that one does not exist?

In this post I will be going over why I beleive this and my thoughts on how company’s should implement a hybrid working environmentDesclamer: My thoughts and opinions are my ownThe Advantages and DisadvantagesThe AdvantagesOne of the main reason I believe that it will work well for companies is it allows employees to have the best of both being in the office with all the advantages that intales as well as the flexibility to work remotely when needed, for example say you need to get work done on your car or you need to travel briefly for personal reasons.Additionally it forces companies to re-evaluate there storage and networking strategies to allow both a more collaborative and more geodiverse functionality leveraging the cloud often times utilizing tools such as Google Drive and M365. That being said while these cloud platforms can be revolutionary from a collaborative standpoint they do leave a lot to be desired from a security standpoint, a great example of this is in Google Workspace you have very limitted options in how you can limit or allow uses to interact with or share filesFurthermore the same strategies required to allow companies to effective implement hybrid work also allow companies to more easily stand up and secure new lowercost office locations from a IT and infrastructure perspective, where all that is really required is a high speed internet connection, a firewall, and a WiFi solution.The DisadvantagesWhile many companies have been embracing the cloud there are some major limitations to the current cloud offerings, some of which are: no cloud platform offers the level of integration both user and machine managemeant that an on premises active directory deployment does You are adding a huge threat vector storing all your data in the cloud and you must have a rock solid security plan to avoid a breach you are trading larger single occurances upfronot costs for ever growing ongoing monthly/yearly license feesTips for your technology stack for an effective Hybrid work environment Pick either M365 or Google workspace but dont mix both The primary reason for this is simpily you will be doubling your cost if you utilze both These platforms due to there nature do not play well together Utilize either Google Drive or OneDrive/Sharepoint for your day to day file storage this will allow you to be able to utilize all the collaborative features that these cloud platforms offer while still allowing you to keep costs down Utilize low cost Object based storage for archival storage Still allows easy access while being stored on a far more cost affective storage model A couple examples of this are Google Cloud Storage (at the Archival tier) or Amazon S3 Glacier When choosing a VPN to access any on premises infrastructure you may still have choose something modern At the very minimum I would recommend utilizing an SSL based VPN but honestly with the introduction of the wireguard protocol and its vastly improved efficiency across the board I would recommend looking into a service such as Tailscale " }, { "title": "Sync Nextcloud Reminders and Calendars on IOS", "url": "/posts/Nextcloud-with-IOS/", "categories": "On-Premise, Nextcloud", "tags": "Linux, File Sharing, IOS, Calander, Tasks", "date": "2024-05-10 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "Prep WorkIn order to utilize Nextcloud to Sync Nextcloud Tasks to Reminders and Nextcloud Calendars to Calendars you must be using HTTPs with a valid SSL Certificate. you can learn more about that here.Setup On your IOS device open the settings app Navigate to Calendars &gt; Accounts Select Add account Select Other Add CalDAV account Enter your Server and Login Infomation and select Next Select Calendars and Reminders to Sync Select SaveSetting Nextcloud Tasks as the default reminders list On your IOS device open the Settings app Naviate to Reminders Set Default List to your prefered Nextcloud Tasks ListSettint Nextcloud Calendar as your Default Calendar On your IOS device open the Settings app Naviate to Calendar Set your Default Calendar to your prefered Nextcloud Calendar" }, { "title": "Virtaul File Support on Linux for the Nextcloud Desktop Agent", "url": "/posts/Nextcloud-agent-virtual-file/", "categories": "On-Premise, Nextcloud", "tags": "Linux, Windows, File Sharing", "date": "2024-04-26 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "What is Virtual File Support?Virtual file support is a feature common to services such as Onedrive or Dropbox where all the files stored on the service cloud storage provider appear in your file system but are never actually downloaded until you open the file.

Simply google anything releated to Firefox’s transition to being a Snap by default on Ubuntu based systems and you will see how bad this can be, to Canonical’s Credit they are active working on improving this and have made huge leaps forward on this front but personally I dont beleive it is ready for graphical desktop applications just yet.Then what is Snap Good for?I beleive that well the main focus for Snap has been desktop applications we may start seeing a shift to more server based software to allow Linux System Administrators to more easily deploy Server applications such as Nextcloud which is a perfect example of what I am talking about, Setting up the nextcloud snap is as easy as installing the package, ensuring your firewall ports are open, and creating a set of admin credentials. Snap offers a couple of key advanates for web applications such as this that traditional deployment methods dont offer Simplicity of deployment Isolating the web application for the base file system to help limit the privlege escalation possibilities Auto update allow you to always stay up to date when there are vulnerabilities are found and fixed No noticable performance difference between Snap and traditioanl deployments in many casesSo if Snap is so great then why isn’t more widely used?Unfortunitly do to the closed source nature of certain aspects of Snap and the delays in launching graphical applications Snaps have gotten a bit of a bad rap. Which is very unfortune since the core technology has the possibility to revoloutionize software deployment on Linux." }, { "title": "How to Renew your Self-Signed Certificate for Windows RDP", "url": "/posts/Renew-RDP-Certificate/", "categories": "On-Premise, Windows Desktop", "tags": "Windows, Certificate, Remote Desktop", "date": "2023-05-26 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": " Open Windows Built in Cert Manager Navigate to Cert\\LocalMachine\\Remote Desktop Delete the Certificate run the below commands net stop SessionEnvnet start SessionEnv " }, { "title": "How To Create a Virtual Machine on XCP-NG from the Command Line (Bash)", "url": "/posts/XCP-NG-vm-creation-cmd/", "categories": "On-Premise, XCP-NG", "tags": "XCP-NG, Virtualization, Linux", "date": "2023-05-12 13:41:44 +0000", "snippet": "Creating the VM ImageList Templatesxe template-list | grep \"Windows Server 2022\"Create the VMxe vm-install template=\"Windows Server 2022 (64-bit)\" new-name-label=\"Windows Server\"Attaching the ISOView the Available ISO’sxe cd-list | grep 2022Attached the ISOxe vm-cd-add uuid=426b9683-a34e-6a83-cee5-d131fa5d66bf cd-name=Windows-Server2022.iso device=1Configure the NetworkingList Configured Networksxe network-listCreate the Interfacexe vif-create vm-uuid=426b9683-a34e-6a83-cee5-d131fa5d66bf network-uuid=6740ed63-ab4b-e86a-01cb-b23c82fc6f12 device=0Resize DiskGet Disk UUIDxe vm-disk-list vm=426b9683-a34e-6a83-cee5-d131fa5d66bfResize Diskxe vdi-resize uuid=de14deea-cbad-4428-9edd-fca87e2c634d disk-size=64GiBIncrease RAMxe vm-memory-limits-set dynamic-max=4GiB dynamic-min=2GiB static-max=4GiB static-min=2GiB uuid=426b9683-a34e-6a83-cee5-d131fa5d66bfStart VMxe vm-start uuid=426b9683-a34e-6a83-cee5-d131fa5d66bf" }, { "title": "Plex Overview", "url": "/posts/Plex/", "categories": "On-Premise, Self Hosted", "tags": "Plex, Linux, Media", "date": "2023-04-28 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "What is Plex?Plex is a self hosted media steaming service.How to Set Plex upPlex Support GuideEditors Note: I recommend running Plex on Linux due to the extreme likelihood that you will have fewer issued with the underlying operating systemMy ThoughtsSo I have been using Plex for awhile now and honestly its been great while I use android boxes to stream the majority of my TV when I am at home, Plex allows me to have that same ability when I am away from home and I don’t have a TV readily available. I have found that I primarily use Plex on my IPad since it has the larges screen out of the devices that I carry excluding my laptop.No auto update systemI found it unusual that the Plex Team opted to force you to redownload the installer everytime there is a software update instead of builiding in an update system like most server softwaresPlex PassWhile I am all for Paying for software that you use I did find it a little annoying that while testing Plex I was limitted to 720P low bitrate without a plex pass when I was not at home. I understand the limitation is likely to prevent people from just using the service for free forever and pushing them towards to the Plex pass which is likely to cover there hosting costs for the proxy servers they definitly use to make accessing your media from anywhere a seamless experiance.

It allows you to seamlessly listen to any audiobooks you have on your Plex server. If you are used to using Audibles mobile app you will feel right at home honestly the styles of both apps are identical.The only issue I have run into is that sometimes I have to completely close the app (stop it from running in the backgroud) and relaunch the app to allow for playback to resume. i suspect this is something to do with jumping between being on my LAN and utilizing the Proxy Servers that Plex maintainsClosing ThoughtsIn closing if you have any kind of local Media collection be it audio or video I would suggest atleast taking a look at Plex.

I could even see where a small Hyper-V server utilized for the same role could be an asset to some organizations.Final ThoughtsWhile I wouldnt suggest replacing products such as VMware Workstation Pro or ESXI with Hyper-V if you have nothing better It will get the job done in a pinch.

One major limitation is that you can only deploy MSI installers not exe. This is primarily due to how the installers are built, there are workarounds for this limitation such as creating a powershell script that runs at login to install certain software.Roaming ProfilesRoaming Profiles allow you to automatically sync your user directory to a central SMB share at both Logon and log off allowing you to always have your same “local” files on any computer you login. While I did heavily test Roaming profiles when building out my deployment I ultimately didnt utilize them due to a few major (atleast for my usecase) issues: Longer Login times The Login time increased from around 30 Seconds to a Minute with minimal data being synced Due to the age of Roaming profiles it lacks certain more modern syncing features such as not completely over writing the content of the SMB share reguardless of if the content in the share is actually newer then the content on the Current PC Essentually You can only be logged into 1 PC at a time which for someone like me who is always logged into there desktop and frequently also using there laptop when not in there office this is not an option Drive MountingThis is simple but extremely helpful you can auto mount SMB Network sharesThemingYou can apply a base theme on a per user bases to help expedite the proccess of customizing and personalizing your Workstations.SSO for all the thingsBetween LDAP and native Active directory authentication options for SSO with other products you will have a hard time finding a enterprise grade application that you wont be able to set up SSO for, additionally with the use of Azure AD sync you can integrate with Microsoft SSO to allow you to utilize the same login credentials for online services as well." }, { "title": "2022 Year in Review", "url": "/posts/2022-Year-in-Review/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "", "date": "2022-12-31 13:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "A lot happened this year some of the highlights are I got married and went on a once in a life time honeymoon, I got to fulfill a life long dream of visiting Massenhoven, I started a new job where i am performing a more technical role, I could probobly keep going but I think I have made my point.

A couple of highlights are: a Modern Design Simple and straight forward process to configure the necessary configuration Btrfs being natively supported is amazing while ext4 is still a suitable file system is is nice to see more and more distributions supporting copy on write file systems will allow us to push it forward and hopefully make it the standardDay to Day UsageThe First few daysHonestly it was just nice being back on Linux again while I do enjoy using Windows as well there is something about the customizability of Linux that has always had me. This is likely in part to the ease of configuring it to meet my workflow whether it is development of IT support or writing for this very website. So far all the tools i use personally i have been able to continue to use on Manjaro although that may be in part due to me transitioning to more web based tools and away from proprietary software.The First WeekI find myself reaching for my laptop more and more as I continue to work through a few ongoing development projects although i did run into my first issue so far and thats that i could not get my laptop to connect to my scanner although as I am writing this I just checked again and now it is connected and ready to scan. In Manjaro’s defense i didn’t spend long to trying to get it to work as i was in the middle of something i needed to finish in a timely manner.ConclusionUnfortunately my testing was cut short due to needing to prepare for my honeymoon and needing a rock solid PC with the ability to download Content from services such as Amazon prime or Netflix.

If you want to learn more about tailscale you can read my artical here .TextasticTextastic is a simple but full featured text editor with built in file browsing that gets the job done. Combine it with a Git client such as working copy and you have a powerful duo.Remote DesktopThis is one area that I am still rather disappointed in IPadOS but this is morely a disappointment with the remote desktop app’s. In my opinion If you offer a remote desktop app on the IPad you should have proper mouse support where if you have a trackpad or mouse connected to your IPad it will just use the remote devices mouse instead of the IPad ”mouse”. The only app that i have seen implement this Microsofts RDP Client.File ManagementLast time I attempted to use my IPad as my as key part of my daily workflow the Files app fell flat on my face for a few key reasons:No persistent SMB ConnectionsThis has since been resolved although I have noticed that you occasionally need to remove and re-add the connection when connecting to the share via a VPN connection but I suspect that has more of a limitation with IPadOS rather then a Files app issueFile Transfer Progress BarThis has been added and it works well enough to get the job doneNote TakingFor me there are two main apps that cover 90% of usecasesOnenoteOnenote is an oldie but a goodie for me I have been using it to keep notes since I was in High School. Onenote is Idea when you need to mix hand written and typed notes as well as File attachments and links to the internet.Good Notes 5A new app that I am just starting to explore, it appears to be great for strictly handwritten notes and marking up PDFs and Presentations.IPadOS Specific ImprovementsDesktop WebpagesThis is a feature of IPadOS that I honestly forgot about until i was rewatching a video going over the original features of when IPad’s transitioned to IPadOS, I suspect this is mainly because it just makes sense why have a webpage optimized for a far smaller screen load by default. Its thanks to this feature that I am able to write this entire post on my IPad with my Magic KeybaordPicture in Picture Video PlaybackThis is a feature I love on my Laptop and it is just as amazing on the IPad, although it would be nice if Youtube would make up there mind if they are going to natively support it in there app instead of this add it as an experimental feature for Youtube Red and then decided to remove it, at least it supported in Chrome.Hotspot Auto-ConnectI have touched on this before but the ability for an IPad to automatically connect to a IPhone’s hotspot without even needing to enable it is amazingConclusionWhile it wont be replacing my laptop anytime soon.

The reason why it is so nice to see is due to the nature of ZFS being a copy on write file system it allows create on-system snapshots of the entire file system to easily rollback to a known good state in the event of an issue with tools such as Sanoid by JIm Salter (check it out on Github)Display Manager TransitionI have mixed feelings about Canonical’s decision to transition to Wayland by default. On one hand I am thrilled to see another major distribution transition to the new display server but this has caused me to discover a few issues during my admittedly short testing, such as legacy apps not working correctly (eg putty not opening the terminal window) or very strange display behaviour when you are virtualisation the release and you have changed the resolution.The reason I am not raking Canonical across the coals for this is because in order to see these issues fix we need to bring the new display server more into the mainstream so that more people are working on improving it and fixing these issuesNetworkingAs a workstation release I believe that you should be able to pull DNS from any network appliance/DNS server that is handling that role on your network regardless of configuration. with Ubuntu 22.04 like many distributions I have tested I cannot get the any of them to recognize any locally hosted DNS Server. It may be a limitation of Gnome I haven’t dived into it that far but until that is changed I can’t run Linux as my daily driver OS.ServerAt the time of release Ubuntu 22.04 is the buggiest version of Linux I have ever run, not a single application that run on Linux will function due to dependency issues. Which makes it hard to test anything, I will likely re-evaluate the server release in a few months but at this point I am evaluating other options for my primary server OS.UpdateThis may not be entirly Ubuntu’s fault as when reasearching this further I discovered some of the services I host on Ubuntu servers utilize very old versions of packages." }, { "title": "How to set up a Site to Site VPN using OpenVPN", "url": "/posts/Site-to-Site-VPN/", "categories": "Networking, VPN", "tags": "Firewall, Linode, VPN", "date": "2022-06-07 22:42:56 +0000", "snippet": "Video GuideWritten GuideServer Log into your PFSense Firewall that will be acting as the server and navigate to VPN &gt; OpenVPN &gt;Servers Select Add Enter the name of the network in the Description Field Set Server Mode to Peer to Peer (Shared Key) Leave encryption algorithm as default Set the IPV4 Tunnel Network to 10.8.0.0/24 Set the IPV4 Remote Networks to whatever the remote network on the other end of the tunnel is Add Firewall rule to open port 1194 on WAN interfaceClient Log into your PFSense Firewall that will be acting as your Client and navigate to VPN ?

You can tell that Fortinet put some thought into the design and features they wanted to offer with the 30E. If I had one complaint it would be that they do not use what most of the industry has adopted as the industry standard barrel plug instead opting for there own 2 prong plug, which will make getting after market adapters much harder.The SoftwareThe Graphical User InterfaceThe GUI is fairly standard and straight forward as far as firewalls goes, one nice feature is that you can disable (hide) features you are not utilizing which allows a more clean interface only offering the features you are using on that device.The Command Line InterfaceHonestly don’t have a ton to say about the CLI, if you have ever used Cisco’s CLI you will feel right at home.Key FeaturesVPNI cannot understate how powerful having a full featured VPN Integrated with your firewall allowing you to perform cross network routing can be, with the options of either IPsec or SSL based remote access VPNs you can be nearly guaranteed that your workstation/end device will be able to connect and access your local recourses from anywhere with a network connection. In addition to the remote access VPN you can also configure seamless Site-to-Site VPN with both the FortiGate Virtual Appliance as well as other FortiGate Hardware devices.DNS ServiceThe ability to run your DNS service directly from your networking appliance can not be overlooked. This allows you to have a full featured (IE custom DNS A Records) DNS Server on your local network without the need for the additional overhead of running a separate workstation or VM to manage and keep up to date.Additionally you can select which interfaces you want to utilize the integrated DNS Server giving you more granular control.CLIWhile most people will likely primarily use the GUI you can’t underestimate the simplicity of the syntax and the versatility of the Command Line Interface as a whole.

Personally I have tried several both for both personal use as well as professionally and have settled on ConnectWise Control previously called Screenconnect.PricingWhile I am not going to talk to much about pricing as it is subject to change at anytime but I will mention that well a ConnectWise Control Standard License isn’t cheap by any means it is a steal compared to there competitors. It blows my mind how much remote desktop software licenses cost. If you ever want to cry go look up what a single license for TeamViewer Costs.SetupThe basic setup to get you up and running is very easy and well some of the more granular features can become a little more complicated ConnectWise has an outstanding knowledge base that is easily searchable and at your disposal in addition to there support team.I think it took me a total of maybe 2 hours from creating my account to being satisficed with how I had the dashboard configured. I do continue to make tweaks to how it is configured but that is more do to learning about additional functionality that I didn’t previously know about rather then not being satisfied with how it is configured.Key FeaturesTool BoxesTool Boxes allow you to run executables on a remote machine without having to manually transfer/download it. This can save a ton of time if you are setting up a couple of family members computers at once remotely just after say Christmas. With the use of an extention you can extend the functionality to commandline commands as well.Extension MarketplaceThe extension marketplace allows you to configure your deployment to better meet your needs, whether it is changing how something appears on screen or adding additional functionality there is likely an extension that will help you achieve what you want to configure.One Time Support SessionsWhile having easy remote access to your parents computer so you can help them fix there printer is great you may not want to always have access to your aunts computer, this is where one time support sessions are great. They allow you to set up a session that will download a custom version of the client connect tool so that when that session is done it automatically deletes itself.Additionally ConnectWise Control offers the most options i have seen for connecting to the one time support sessions. I have included the list bellow: Code you enter on the website Email invitation Custom link you could send via chat app Calendar EventSupport ClientsWhile ConnectWise Control does not have the largest list of support clients out of the remote desktop software’s I have looked at it is still rather comprehensive. It supports: Windows Mac Linux Only Debian and Rhel based Distros IOS/Android You can only remotely view the screen not interact with it and you cant have persistent access it is only available via the single support sessions Overall ThoughtsThe UI and UX are enterprise quality although what would you expect from an enterprise remote desktop software. The pricing is extremely competitive and scales with you as your needs expand. Unlike most of there competitors with there standard license you have access to all the core features of the platform with no restrictions. Personally moving forward I am going to be using ConnectWise Control for my remote desktop software and I would recommend at the very least you check out there 14 day free trial.

While it does leave a little to be desired from a more technical user it is reliable and easy to use, which above all else is the primary requirement for a great installerThe BadFrom a security perspective I love the mandate of the TPM2.0 module but as someone who supports there family who use much older hardware it makes it at least a little more difficult to recommend Windows 11 to them, the only saving grace is that you can bypass the TPM Mandate when installing the operating system nativelySetupWhile Microsoft threw a new coat of paint on the Setup wizard functionally it is identical to the Windows 10 installer with the same default settings with the one exception being that if you don’t have a pro or higher license you have to set up the primary account on the device with a Microsoft accountDay to Day UseGeneral UseOnce you move the start button to its rightful spot in the bottom left corner of the screen Windows 11 functions almost identically as Windows has all the way back to Windows 98. That being said under the hood there are some advantages such as better battery life, less bloat, and better hardware utilization. Additionally shot for shot Windows 11 appears to have launched with far fewer bugs then Windows 10 did.WSLGIn Windows 11 the WSL implementation is extraordinary it nearly bridges the gap between Windows and Linux. With the implementation of the graphics subsystem you can now run nearly 100% of Workstation applications that would require a Linux desktop previously.In closingI have been using Windows 11 since launch day and have been very satisfied with it .

While I do admit it looks really nice it is missing key features for configuring your network, I am not going to get into the specifics here because it has been beaten to death and is apt to change as they continue to develop this new interface. Personally I do primarily use the old user interface because it provides the full functionality I have come to expect from there competitors such as Cisco’s Meraki. To Ubiquiti’s credit they do still give you the options to switch between the two user interfaces so that you can still get the full featured old user interface.Hosting the ControllerOne thing I do like about the Unifi controller over similar offerings from there competitors. Is that you have to host your own controller. This means that you aren’t at the mercy of Ubiquiti to continue to support the controller forever.IOS Connectivity IssuesOne word of warning to anyone looking at building out a Unifi Network Stack there appears to be long standing issues with Unifi’s default configuration that causes IOS devices to randomly disconnect from the network. To Unifi’s credit within the Controller you do have the ability to toon the network to help prevent this for the most part although you are completely at the whim of both Apple and Ubiquiti to not break it completely.Unifi Routing Hardware and SoftwareUp until this point I have focused solely on Ubiquiti’s Switch and Access Point Offerings this because while they do have a routing solution based on the research I have done unless all you have is the ISP provided router/modem you likely will be better off long term choosing a different optionMy thoughts on the Unifi Product line as a holeWhile Ubiquiti’s Unifi Line of products does have its issues and quarks so does every cloud managed Network platform.

This is invaluable for two reasons one being if the device is ever stolen as long as they don’t crack your key your data is secure. The second is if your NAS is in a hostile network it adds one extra layer of security for your data.SMB/SambaThe SMB File Shares are simple but get the job done, You can easily manage individual user permissions as well as group permissions. You can also prevent users from users from editing existing files or downloading files off the network share. The Ladder of these features would be very useful to ensure employees or your family isnt downloading the file to there PC circumventing the NAS’s Redundancy and security entirely.NFSGetting the Network File Sharing Protocol (NFS) working is as easy as enabling the service in settings and adding a host to the allowed device list (Whitelist) for the share you would like to make availableUser ManagementIf you have ever administered a Windows Active Directory then the User creation and management will be very familiar to you. You only need a username and password to create a account but you can also add a email to allow password resets via email (if the feature is enabled and configured). Once the User account is created you are given quite a few QoS features such as: Per volume storage quota Per service Bandwidth limit Share permission Management Per application permission Management Data RedundancyCloud BackupVery much like TrueNAS you are able to back up your Synology NAS to most popular cloud platforms including several S3 Storage Providers. You can find a full link of the support platforms here: https://www.synology.com/en-ca/dsm/6.2/software_spec/cloud_sync.Data ScrubsWhile I was unable to test the Data Scrubbing due to it not being support on my model of NAS. My Understanding is that Synology is utilizing BtrFS to Scan your Data at the block level to ensure data integrity so that you wont fall victim to what is known as bit-rot.Shared Folder SnapshotsAgain Unfortunately I was unable to test this due to it not being support on my configuration, but what this allows you to do is essentially take snapshots in time of the Shared folder so that you can easily roll back to it to either recover from Malware or recover a deleted file. This is utilizing the BtrFS filesystem to allow this to work.Additional AppsIn addition to the core functionality of being a File Server. Synology offers a verity of Apps that add additional functionality such as being able to easily back up all the Photos on your phone (Yes this works on iPhone), or a Google Drive Replacement, or add a VPN Connection so that you can access it securely remotely without opening any firewall portsOverall UI and UXThe UI is very Gnome like in that everything is a a app that you open on a desktop environment that lives in your web browsers. To be honest at first I hated it but it has grown on me the more I have used it to the point where now that I am familiar with it I almost prefer it over other web based UI’s such as cockpit, While at first glance it appears to be super simple upon further inspection it has most of the advanced features you would expect and require.Closing ThoughtsIn Closing I am looking forward to when I can replace my Primary NAS with a Synology NAS with btrfs so that I can still take advantage of the File Integrity checking and Snapshotting. If you need an easy to use and manage NAS I would highly suggest taking a look at Synology they have some very competitive options when it comes to price and performanceUseful Links:Full Walktough for setting up Synology DSM 7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyQy4Wj679A&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=WunderTechLive Demo of DSM 6.2 and 7.0:https://demo.synology.com/en-ca/dsm?utm_source=feature&amp;utm_medium=CloudSync&amp;_ga=2.268495158.656428049.1634853140-2023181413.1634853140" }, { "title": "Nextcloud Spotlight", "url": "/posts/Nextcloud-Spotlight/", "categories": "On-Premise, Self Hosted", "tags": "Spotlight, Linux, Docker, Nextcloud", "date": "2021-08-14 01:02:10 +0000", "snippet": "OverviewNextcloud is self hosted cloud platform that gives almost feature parity to platforms such as Google’s Workspace platform.InstallationNextcloud can be easily installed via the following ansible playbook apt install ansible ansible-pull -U https://github.com/ryanvanmass/Nextcloud_Ansible Deploy.ymlKey FeaturesAll of these Key features can be easily installed and configured via the Apps Store within the Web UI and integrate with each other.Tasks and DeckTasksTasks is your traditional ToDo List with the added ability of being able to share Tasks and ToDo lists with other usersDeckDeck is your traditional Kanban Board software that fully integrates with tasks as well as your Calendar allowing you to easily manage tasks you or your team are working on as well as tasks you have assigned to other usersFilesAllows you to backup and manage your files from an easy to use Web UICalendar/Mail/ContactsGives you all the functionality of a software such as outlook but with a modern design and from a web browserOnlyOfficeWith an easy to Configure OnlyOffice Document Server Integration you can edit and collaborate on Documents from either the Nextcloud directory via the web browser or from the Onlyoffice Desktop editor which can also connect to NextcloudFile SharingFile Sharing allows you to easily share files both internally and externally via easy to manage Download and collaboration linksAdvantages over services such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365The biggest advantage of a platform such as Nextcloud is obviously cost aside from the cost of running the server to host Nextcloud there are no mandatory license fees.

The two main ones are the lack of external monitor support and the lack of decent multitasking. This post will be going over what I choose to not replace but go with my IPad for when I just need to get work done.HardwareI purchased a used Dell XPS 13 9365 2 in one. I had a couple of Key requirements when looking for a laptop: Type C Charging Lightweight Decent Battery life Enough RAM that if i wanted to run a VM on it i could all Solid State StorageThe Dell XPS 9365 meets all these requirements and a few more. It also has thunderbolt, Windows Hallo, a fingerprint scanner, and a touch screen. The only major downside I have found so far with the laptop is that the webcam is under the screen instead of above which if i used it would cause the person on the other side of the call to see right up my noise.SoftwareOSI choose to run PopOS 21.04 which of course is Linux, after troubleshooting windows 10 all day at work one of the last things I want to do is have to deal with it when I am not work. Also I have found myself missing certain pieces of software that I used to use when I ran LinuxMust have software I missedRemminaRemmina is a remote desktop software that allows you to connect to devices via RDP, VNC, SPICE, SSH, etc. I have written a full post on it I would recommend going and giving it a read./etc/hostsYes this is technically a file not a program but until you have realized how useful being able to map hostnames to IPs on a host by host bases you will not understand how useful it is.NetworkManagerThe customization and versatility of NetworkManger is unmatched in Windows and MacOS alike. If you ever want to learn what a truly versatile networking subsystem is I would recommend giving NetworkManager a look.Seamless integration with self hosted servicesWhile Windows almost seamlessly integrates with most self hosted services it will never have the level of integration a open source operating system, this is due to the closed source nature of Windows the integration is never quite perfect and never will be as long as Windows is closed source.Closing thoughtsI have only had my new laptop for just over 24 hours so it is still very much so early days but so far I am loving it.

I decided to do something on this trip that I have never done and thought I would never do and that was leave my Laptop at home, I traveled with nothing but my IPad and IPhone. This post will be going over some of the really cool ways that this setup allowed me to either just as easily or more easily complete all the same tasks that I normally would.ProductivityHaving my VPN gateway set up allowed me to easily connect to my self-hosted services, such as my file server and website draft server. Having access to these allowed me to easily work on the notes for this post as well as the post itself.The IPad defaulting to the desktop version of websites allowed me to easily look up attractions in the area we were well in the car without having to deal with the truly terrible mobile versions most websites have.PhotographyIt’s likely a surprise to no one with me using both an IPhone and IPad that I use ICloud to sync my pictures between them. I never really appreciated how seamless this was until i was getting back in the car from taking a picture of something and grabbed my IPad because i wanted to do a quick edit to see what it would look like to have the picture i wanted to edit already sitting on my IPad waiting for me. That’s not to be underscored by how easy it is and how useful it can be to be able to edit your pictures while you are still sitting at the location you took them at to make sure that you don’t want to get a slightly different image to work withEntertainmentWhile I was in the Hotel room I did have an Android Box with me to be able to watch what ever I or more accurately my Fiance wanted, shout out to EDMI for having amazing customer service as well as a great product you can find out more about them on there website here. While the android box was great for the hotel room it wasn’t very useful for while I was in the car, for that I actually didn’t watch to much since one of the main goals for the trip was to go site seeing but I did listen to part of an audio book and watch a movie on my phone which both were alright but all in all trying to watch tv or movies on your phone at least still sucks and your IPad is almost to big to watch anything for an extended period of time for in a vehicle.MiscI liked the ability that the IPad had to automatically connect to an IPhones Hotspot before the trip but I didn’t didn’t really appreciate it until I was on the trip.ConclusionTraveling with an IPad can work very well depending on what you want to do while you are travelling.

This is simply what I have found works for me.What is ADHDADHD or Attention Defaced disorder is a medical condition that causes you to find it difficult if not impossible to focus on one task at a time or to stay focused for long periods of time.So How do you Focus?Planning your DayIf I don’t plan out my day the chances of me actually getting anything done drop exponentially. In my experience unless I plan my day first thing in the morning (right after making coffee) I wont plan it out which of course leads to me not getting anything done that day.Sticking to your PlanI have also found it useful to have my todo list always visible as a reminder of what you are suposed to be dong. This way you can always glance at it and remember what you should be working on and what is next on your listTaking BreaksAs funny as it may sound one of the most useful tools I have found that helps me focus is taking breaks. Taking a break allows you to relax and not focus on anything so that when it comes time again to focus you are ready and able.Taking breaks to “focus” on something you enjoyI have found it useful to add a couple tasks that I am looking forward to or enjoy doing in to my plan for the day so that way I can use them to push myself to complete the other tasks on my todo list.Removing distractionsOne of the best things I did in College was buying a good pair of noice cancelling headphones. This allows me to block out all the distractions of the outside world while still being able to listen to the music, podcasts, or Youtube videos that help me focusBackground NoiceAs I just eluded to I spent a good portion of my day with something playing. This allows me to focus because in addition to helping block out the outside world it also helps keep me focused in on one thing instead of chasing every new thought that pops into my mind.Learning when you are most focusedwhile my level of focus varys from day to day I do find I am most focused first thing in the morning and then again in early evening. Knowing this allows me to plan my day around that. For example I will always do my most pressing/urgent work related tasks first thing in the morning and in the early evening I often work on a passion project such as writing posts for this website or editing pictures I have taken.The Most Important thing to RememberThe most important thing to remember about trying to focus when you have ADHD is to not get discouraged or mad at yourself for not being able to focus. Instead just know that tomorrow is a new day and that you can always get caught up on whatever it is you need to do." }, { "title": "Tablet Workflow 3 Months later", "url": "/posts/TabletWorkflowRevisited/", "categories": "On-Premise, IOS", "tags": "IOS", "date": "2021-06-11 00:28:23 +0000", "snippet": "BackgroundBack in Febuary of this year I decided to give using a IPad as a main productivity machine instead of a laptop a try.

While there are IDE’s that run natively on an IPad I have grown to used to some of the features of VS Code which has made it difficult to give up.Photo EdittingThanks to ICloud automatically syncing the pictures I take on my IPhone and Snapseeds decent Apple Pencil support. I am able to easily edit any pichure I take. Which is nice since I have always enjoyed editting my pichures but rarely used to do it due to the pain in the ass that was importing any pictures I tookGamingThanks to apps like Steam Link and the Xbox app. I am able to easily stream any game I own on both PC and Xbox to my IPad allowing me to game from anywhere in the house or anywhere with an internet connection with the use of my VPN.WorkingWhile I do still use my Windows Laptop for the bulk of my work at work I find myself recently using my IPad as a media consumption device while working partially due to being able to awnser any phone calls that come in on my work phone from my IPad meaning I dont have to take out one set of headphones to put in another anymore, which while it was a minor inconviance it is still nice not having to do it anymore.I also find myself using my IPad to take notes more easiy during a meeting since it allows me to have the meeting open on my main monitor and my notes just bellow it.I also find myself sometimes taking meetings on my IPad since I am able to easily connect my AirPods and have decent enough audio. This allows me to listen to a meeting while still being able to work on something on my main MonitorPortabilityI must admit the portability of an IPad over my 15.7 inch MSI gaming Laptop is unmeashurable. It is so nice being able to just grab it under one arm and walk outside to sit on the padio and awnser email or walk out to my car and throw it on the passanger seat for if I want to use it where ever I end upMultitaskingOnce you get used to it multitasking on the IPad can become very useful having the ability to have two apps open at the same time I would say is almost a game changer, for example you can have your note taking app of choice open as well as a document or web page that you are making notes about without having to switch between them. The Introduction of slide over apps was another great addition being able to quickly and easily access apps such as your todo app without having to leave what you are doing is amazingAutomationI have only been playing around with Shortcuts for a few days at the time of writing this post but I can already say they seem to be very useful. I will likely end up writing an entire post about them once I have had a chance to use them a little more so I won’t say to much about them here.The BadExternal Monitor SupportTheres no suger coting this external monitor support sucks on IPadOS it only Mirrors your display in the native aspect ratio of the IPad (4:3). At the time of writing this WWDC 2021 just happened and it appears we will be stuck with the same sucky external monitor support for another yearVirtulizationWith working within the IT industry I find myself often needing to run virtual machines to test something. Unfortunitly there is little to no support to run virtual machines on an IPad although I am curious to see if this changes now that the IPad Pros are running the same CPU as the Mac Books and IMacs (M1)The PriceHonestly this is still my biggest complaint about the IPad while I do love my IPad I do believe it was to expensive to get both the IPad itself as well as the first party accessories that we all know have the best support and provide the best experience.The UnknownUnfortunitly do to Covid restrictions in my area I havent had the opertunity to travel much, so I am still unsure if the IPad is able to replace the need for a personal Laptop when I am traveling although I should know that soon enough as my Fiancé and I have planned a little get away for the Canada Day Weekend and I plan on only bringing my IPad as my only computing device. I may write a follow up post about how that goes.SummaryIn Summary while I believe that the IPad and first party accessories are to expensive, I love my IPad because it allows me to achieve my goal of not being stuck behind my desk all day. Furthermore after having used my IPad for an extended period of time I can say without a doubt that it will be the only tablet I will be recommending moving forward." }, { "title": "Staying Connected", "url": "/posts/StayingConnected/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "Linux, Windows, IOS", "date": "2021-06-04 18:58:32 +0000", "snippet": "The Importances of statying connectedLike most people I find myself wanting to be connected to what is going on all the time. Although unlike most people I prefer to host as much of my own infustructure as possible instead of relying on services such as OneDrive or Google Drive.How do I Stay Securely Connected?I primarily stay connected to my self hosted infustructure via a VPN that I have set up on a VPS (Virtual Private Server). This allows me to always be able to connect to my local network virtually, Where this can be useful is when the world does reopen and I begin travelling more again. I will be able to access my file server from anywhere that I have a internet connection which thanks to my phone having aton of data and how easy it is to hotspot between Apple devices is just about anywhere.Why always being connected can be useful.If you are anything like me you hate being stuck behind your desk but you still need to be able to get work done. Being always connected allows you to be able to just get up, grab your computer and go work somewhere else that has an internet connection, Which thanks to mobile data is almost anywhere.SyncthingSynthing is a file syncing app so that you always have an identical copy of a file in multiple locations such as your server and main laptop or your desktop and laptopServeditorServeditor is an IPad optimized client for Code-Server, which is an web app based IDE.Firefox or ChromeIf you are like me you use Windows instead of OSX being able to send tabs between devices is awesome for looking up something quicking while your out and continue reading about it on your computer when you get home, or having all your bookmarks on all your devices is amazing.Being too connectedWhile being conected can be great it is very important to know when to disconnect so that you aren’t working 24/7. Personally while it is rare that I leave the house for any extended period of time without my IPad which is connected to all my work as well as personal accounts, it is rare that I use it for anything more then watching a youtube video when I am taking a break from driving or sitting in a parking lot eating because when I am not home and not working that is my time to disconnect generally.

I have decided to give using a IPad as a mobile workstation a try. To be clear for the majority of my work I am still using a Windows or Linux based PC’s but I wanted to see if I can replace my old, large, and bulky laptop that I have been using when I don’t feel like working at my desk with a Tablet I also wanted the ability to more easily work while on the go as while Covid has prevented me from traveling as much as I would like I do still travel to visit family and friends a fair bit (when Provincial and National restriction allow). Bellow will be a a short synopsis of my day to day requirements for and usage of technology.WorkI work as a Technical Support Analyst supporting over 60 sites across North America. I spend the vast majority of my time in remote desktop software as well as a web browser both for helpdesk as well as making configuration changes. I also spend alot of time in my email both sending and receiving emailsPersonalI spend the majority of my time listening to Youtube while either administrating my own servers or working on this website.The SetupAs important as my impressions and observation are they are all but useless if i don’t include what i am using as a setup, bellow is a full list of the hardware I have utilized during my testingIPad Airhttps://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-airKeybardhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXQT2LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air-4th-generation-and-ipad-pro-11-inch-2nd-generation-us-englishApple Pencel 2https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/The First Week For the first few days i utilized the app version of all the main services i use with the exception of the helpdesk software we use at work as i already knew i would prefer the web version as it gives me more control over how i interact with the helpdesk. Around Day 4 i started using youtube in the web browser instead of in the app as it will allow me to use picture in picture mode allowing me to do such things as listen to a youtube video while writing this post. I like the versatility of being able to use the IPad as a tablet when i need a tablet and as a small laptop when i need a laptop. A large part of this i believe is due to by default in the web browser IPad OS displays the desktop version of websites instead of the mobile version favored by IOS (IPhones). It is nice how my AirPods can be seamlessly switched between my IPhone and my IPad allowing me to only carry one pair of headphones for all my devices Not being able to easily silence all notifications is proving annoying. I have since discovered there is an easy to access software button in the control center The Type C Charging is a little annoying as it means when traveling in addition to carrying a lightning cable for my iPhone and AirPods i also need to carry a type C cable for my IPad, but if it means that apple accepts the industry standard for mobile devices long term i am happy to carry the 2 cables for the time being The Lack of a headphone jack or type c to headphone adapter was a tad annoying when i wanted to connect my IPad to some audio equipment to listen to music. Easily solvable with a cheap adapter from Amazon that i can just throw in my bag for the once in a blue moon i want to actually connect it to a sound systemThe Second Week This week I integrated the IPad into my workflow for meetings at work utilizing it to more easily take notes in said meetings. I have been both utilizing the Apple Pencel as well as the keyboard to take notes depending on the meeting, For those curious I use OneNote for all my note taking. I have begun testing the set up as a more portal way to be able to not always be stuck at my desk all day. I am utilizing remote desktop software to connect to my PC at my desk for the few jobs that i cannot complete on my IPad which are proving to far and few in betweenThe Third Week So Far this week I find myself reaching for my IPad for more and more of my day to day tasks such as: Creating My ToDo List each day Checking my Email Catching what happened overnight on the Helpdesk for work Checking my Calendar By the end of the week it is rare that I am not found in the same room as my IPad This week I had to troubleshoot an issue with one of my servers all but dieing. Once I got past the Server not connecting to the network the IPad was a very useful tool to have a ssh session open to easily copy config’s from backups and Documentation I haveConclusionWhile IPadOS still has a long way to go before I would look at replacing my Windows and Linux PC’s with it as my daily driver. I do believe it is ready to replace my old Laptop thats sole purpose was to allow me to not be at my desk when doing some work. It allows me to do 80% of what I would normally do on my PC’s and for the most part thanks to cross platform tools as well as a few self hosted ones I am able to use the same tools on both my IPad as well as my PC’s. I have included a Wish list of features I hope Apple adds to IPadOSWish List Proper multi-monitor support. Currently you can only mirror your IPad display it would be nice to be able to use it as a second display like on a traditional PC The ability to change trackpad and mouse settings individually I want the ability to configure natural scrolling depending on if i am using a trackpad or a mouse The ability to use multitasking with more then 2 apps at a time" }, { "title": "Relationships in Covid", "url": "/posts/Relationships-In-Covid/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "", "date": "2021-02-12 13:42:40 +0000", "snippet": "Background on my storyI have been with my Fiance for the last 6 years the majority of this time was spent dating long distance, I decided that for christmas of 2020 that i was going to surprise my at the time Girlfriend and proposed of course she said yes.DatingA little more backgroundSo when Covid first hit i was living by myself finishing my schooling.

About 3 days ago I had a System Failure and it got me thinking about how easy it is to be prepared for a system failure yet so few people are ready for it.Recovering from an OS FailureIn GeneralRegardless of what your Operating System is make sure you know what is running on your system before you have a system failure if nothing else it will give you a great starting point for rebuilding the systemLinuxOn Linux recovering from a OS failure is simple if you spent the 5 minutes to install a backup tool such as timeshift that will automatically make snapshots of your system on a set schedule. if you have done this recovering from a OS failure is as simple as booting into a liveUSB environment installing your chosen backup tool and restore the most recent snapshot.If you didn’t set up a automatic backup system then recovering on Linux is still rather easy all you need to do is still boot into a liveUSB environment and copy any config files and data you need to keep to a different drive then reinstall your chosen distribution then copy the config files and data back followed by a reboot.Common Config Files to save Fstab Crontab Application Specific ConfigWindowsHonestly on Windows i have never found an easy to use backup tool that worked particularly well. so instead what i recommend is insure you have any data you don’t want to loose either backed up on a cloud service such as Dropbox or OneDrive or to have it stored on a different drive then the OS and to just reinstall Windows and start freshTLDRTake a little bit of time and plan on how you will recover from a system failure be it hardware or software so that it doesn’t come back to bite you in the ass down the road.

There are many softwares out there that resolve this issue like TeamViewer or AnyDesk. While most of these softwares have free offerings either they limit the software tools that make the software useful or in TeamViewers case they have some proccess that determines (usally incorrectly in my experiance) if you are using it for buisness use and bricks the install and the account until you buy a licence.RealVNC takes a different approach. To my knowlege you get the full software tool set or atleast they give you access to all the tools that make the software useful for an application like this. The only limitation that they seem to set is that with the free licence you can only have 5 Devices running the server software associated with a account at any given time.Operating System SupportServer side Windows Linux Mac OS Rasperry Pi Solaris HP-UX AIXViewer Side Windows Linux Mac OS Rasperry Pi Solaris HP-UX AIX Chrome IOS AndroidMore InformationFor more information visit: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/" }, { "title": "Remmina Spotlight", "url": "/posts/Remmina-Spotlight/", "categories": "On-Premise, Linux Desktop", "tags": "Spotlight, Linux", "date": "2020-08-19 16:00:34 +0000", "snippet": "IntroductionHaving a good remote desktop client is crucial to anyone who has ever had to use one for more then 5 minutes and if you are anything like me you have tried your fair share on garbage clients.

So it is safe to say that I spend a lot of time in front of my desk at home.Getting out of the officeGetting out of the office is a weird and tough concept when you work from home. You never really leave the office and if you’re like me (working in IT) even when you do leave your house, work still follows you in the form of emails and phone calls. Finding a work-life balance is crucial if you want to be able to do it long term. One thing I found that has helped me is having a separate computer that has all my work stuff on it so that way I have to take out that computer to be able to do work if I want to do it when I’m not actually working.Taking your office mobile and going offlineSo today I decided to try something new, I decided to take my office mobile as I am writing this I am currently sitting under a train bridge by a river and it has been amazing to be able to sit somewhere and do something put my laptop back in my bag go somewhere else and continue working on something else and with not having the internet distracting me it has allowed me to focus on whatever it is I’m working on without the distractions of Facebook, Youtube, Messenger, etc.Taking your Office to the local coffee shopThis has always been a weird concept to me why would you want to go to a coffee shop to do work. But once again as I am writing this I am now sitting at a picnic table in a park and its starting to make more sense. I am getting a lot more work done not having the distractions of my Xbox and TV fighting for my attention. I can now see the benefit of having an internet connection in that environment so that you can answer email or update Github repositories or answer questions on a community forum.ConclusionIn conclusion, I would recommend that if you have the opportunity to get out of the house to work every now and again take that opportunity and enjoy it." }, { "title": "How to Install and Optimize VMware Workstation for Linux", "url": "/posts/VMWare-On-Linux/", "categories": "On-Premise", "tags": "Linux, How-Tos", "date": "2020-08-12 15:04:13 +0000", "snippet": "IntroductionVMWare Workstation is one of the leading Hyper-Visor softwares, which allows you to run Virtual Machines to complete various tasks.Basic Overview Download VMWare Workstation Installer Run Insraller Launch VMWare Workstation Complete Configuration with VMWare WorkstationDownloading VMware WorkstationRun wget https://download3.vmware.com/software/wkst/file/VMware-Workstation-Full-15.5.6-16341506.x86_64.bundle or go to VMware.com and select Download Now under Workstation for LinuxInstalling VMwareRun sudo sh ./VMware-Workstation-Full-15.5.6-16341506.x86_64.bundle to run the installer you just downloadedLaunch VMWare Workstation and follow the onscreen prompts to finish the installation proccessOptimizing VMWareRun sudo vmware to launch vmware as root so you can make configuratiuon chagnesSelect EditSelect PreferencesSelect MemorySelect Fit all vurtual machine memory into reserved host RAMOptional: Reduce reserved MemoryUninstalling VMWareRun sudo vmware-installer -u vmware-workstation" }, { "title": "Florida2020", "url": "/posts/Florida2020/", "categories": "Photography", "tags": "Florida, Girlfriend", "date": "2020-08-10 16:00:12 +0000", "snippet": "InsightBack in Febuary before the world shutdown (thanks covid) my girfriend and I went on a vaction to Florida and bellow are some of the pichures we took.The Wizarding World of Hary PotterI must say that the emercion in the wizarding world of Harry potter was amazing from the “Staff Onlys” signs being labeled as no muggles to the staff dressing in robes and if they see guests also wearing robes they say things like “welcome back to class”.Who doens’t want to see Head Master Albus Dumbledore’s officeJust a really cool shot down diagon ally at Greengots with a dragon on the roofAll aboard the Hogwarts exppress next stop Hogsmead StationBlack Spire Out_postsThe Spires that give Black Spire its name (atleast according to me)A Local Artisans shopStorage for the local droid depoA really cool look at some the the scenery at the out_postsLand MarksWish I could have gotten a better pichure of just the castle if im being honest![6image](/assets/2020/Florida2020/MS2.jpgAgain I wish i had gotten a better pichure of the globe.
